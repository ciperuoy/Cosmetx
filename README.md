# Cosmetx
A nice and fun mod to allow yourself to have every cosmetic in the game. This includes unreleased items, and the stick!

Allow expressing yourself to be a choice! The current cosmetics you have I bet are boring! What about looking like a fingerpainter? Maybe a moderator?

This mod is client-sided, meaning only you, and people who have the mod, will see it.

# Additional

Remember, this is just a remake. I just rewrote the code to make it work in publics, and also deleted some stuff that conflicted with the code.
